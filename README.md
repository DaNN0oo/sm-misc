sm-misc
===========================

[![Build status](http://ci.splewis.net/job/sm-misc/badge/icon)](http://ci.splewis.net/job/sm-misc/)

This is a collection of various, mostly unrelated, sourcemod plugins. Most are for CS:GO. Some may be labelled as for CS:GO, but work more generally.

## Downloads

Since these plugins are small and unrelated, there is no stable, overall release. There are only [continuous builds](http://ci.splewis.net/job/sm-misc/lastSuccessfulBuild/) for them all. When using these, the version number of each plugin will be the build number.

## Installations

Installation instructions vary by plugin. For most, you only need to move the plugin binary (the .smx file) into ``addons/sourcemod/plugins`` and you will be good to go. Some plugins may have cvars, and some might create a config file to set those cvars when the plugin first starts. Generally, those will be in ``cfg/sourcemod/<plugin_name>.cfg``.


## Plugin descriptions

TODO.

For now, you can can find some descriptions in the [source code](https://github.com/splewis/sm-misc/scripting) for the plugins, in the description field.
